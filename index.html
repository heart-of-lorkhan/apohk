              <p><strong>A Plastic Ocean Foundation</strong> is not an anti-plastic organisation. We agree plastic is an amazing product; versatile, cheap, light, and it saves a lot of lives too - think of plastics used in medicine!</p>
              <p>It’s how we dispose of plastic that is causing the problem. Our addiction to plastic and our ‘disposable’ lifestyle are now starting to pose a threat to the survival of marine species, as well as ourselves! </p>
              <p>Please remember plastic does not degrade, or decompose. It is virtually indestructible and while you can throw it away, you cannot get rid of it. It stays with us forever.</p>
